Definition
An engineer is a practitioner of engineering, concerned with applying scientific knowledge, mathematics, and ingenuity to develop solutions for technical, societal and commercial problems. The word engineer is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness").

Engineers develop new technological solutions.

Amongst other more detailed findings, a recent work sampling study[11] found that engineers spend 62.92% of their time engaged in technical work, 40.37% in social work, and 49.66% in computer-based work. Furthermore, there was considerable overlap between these different types of work, with engineers spending 24.96% of their time engaged in technical and social work, 37.97% in technical and non-social, 15.42% in non-technical and social, and 21.66% in non-technical and non-social.

So the interesting facts about engineering students: This is basically from the teacher's point of view: 
Enjoy life along with balancing studies (I am ignoring the ones who are casual, study at the last moment and just give the exam)
Good logical and analytical thinking
Smart workers
Confident
Can multiplex tasks
May lack some depth in building relationships
Good technology awareness and usage
Urge to prove themselves
Good time management skills
Ability to adapt to varied situations
Often  I have ended up becoming student and learnt from them

They have to miss one of these everyday,either ATTENDANCE of first class or BREAKFAST.
3)For engineers every course APART FROM ENGINEERING is easy.
4) An engineer has the power of getting up at 7.55 am and reaching the class at 8.00 am.
5) T-SHIRT and JEANS are engineer's NATIONAL DRESS and MAGGI is the NATIONAL FOOD.
6) A normal person will fix the broken things but an engineer will first break a thing and then he would fix it.
7) An engineer can build a car, spaceship and they even can make time machine. However, he just can’t build a relationship with a girl.
8) An engineer doesn't care for the rise in price of petrol or gold but he gets mad when cigarette costs Rs.5.50 instead of 5.20.
9)An engineer loves to solve a problem. If there is no problem, then he will create one and would start solving it.
10) An engineer can derive any relation just give them the final expression.
11)Are you made of copper(CU) and tellurium(TE), because you’re CUTE. This is how engineers flirt.
12) An engineers’s worst nightmare is teacher taking the class but not taking the attendance.
13) An engineer can finish his syllabus in one night.
14)An Engineer knows nothing, but only an Engineer knows this.
15) An Engineer will never sleep in night and will never wake up in morning.
16) An Engineer is the most innocent person in front of his parents.
17) Never argue with an engineer because arguing with Engineers is like killing the mosquito on your cheek, you might or might not kill it, but you’ll end up slapping yourself.
18) The most common dialogue on the opening day of an engineering college is, “Bhai, iss saal bhi koi khaas ladkiya nahi hain!”
19) No one can speak better English than an engineer who is having a bottle of beer in his hand.
20) There is always a hidden folder in engineer's laptop

Heated gold is called gold, beated copper is called wire, compressed carbon is called diamond and heated, beated and compressed person is called an engineer.
Long time ago, people who sacrificed their sleep, family, food, laughter and other joys of life were called saints, now they are called engineers
Your family members will not consider you an engineer unless you don't repair any home appliances.

Every girl would have at least five proposals no matter how she looks
Every branch almost have same Lab but nobody knows how it actually works even the professors LOL.


Last April, 1.4 million candidates appeared for the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), making it one of the biggest single day exams in human history
The number of people who appeared for that single exam is more than the total number of people who appeared for the GMAT and GRE put together, across the entire world, that entire year
India produces about 1.5 million engineers every year
That’s more engineers, annually, than twice the population of Iceland
And it’s way more engineers than the United States and China produce every year. Combined.
The engineering coaching industry in India is worth multiple billions of dollars.
And it spins more money every year than all of Bollywood.
Nearly 16% of startups in Silicon Valley have had an Indian co-founder.
Which is the highest for an immigrant country, and higher than Britain, China, Taiwan, and Japan combined.
Various industry reports suggest more than 75% of engineers in India are simply unemployable.
And more than half of Indian engineers take it up as a career either because of their parents or because “they don’t know what else to do”.
Which is why basically every field in India – no matter how non-engineering related – is littered with engineering graduates.
An if engineering were a religion in India, it would be the fifth most popular one.
